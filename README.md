# Mentor Mentee Platform                                                        
 
Find a mentor-platform: A matchmaking platform where people entering the tech workspace can find mentors already established in the field.
  
This project has been started in the [Rails Girls Copenhagen learners group](https://www.meetup.com/Rails-Girls-Copenhagen/).
In 2019 we got together as a group and spent some time talking about what members of the community need and what problem they would like to solve together with this project. The result was the Mentor-Mentee App! 

### Project Goals                                                    
 1. To build a service connecting newcomers to the field with mentors that can help them grow technically and professionally.
 2. To be a beginner-friendly project that offers its contributors a welcoming and encouraging setting to advance their skills and learn new technologies.
 
Contributors have formed three separate groups:                                 
 - Frontend (React)                                                                
 - Backend (Ruby on Rails)                                                         
 - Design/Project Ownership                                                        
                                                                                  
So far, the groups have laid out a lot of the groundwork, have created a fair amount of issues and set up a very elaborate wiki in our repo. This is a beginner(junior)-friendly project with a established community of contributors and mentors.

### Contribute
We're always happy to invite new contributors, particularly people new to progamming and who belongs to a group that is not already so well-represented in tech. We also very enthusiastically welcome more seasoned folks who wants to mentor and help our beginner-contributors out. Check out our issues to see which tasks we have ahead. Feel free to join our [Rails Girls cph slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/railsgirlscopenhagen/shared_invite/enQtMzczNDA3NzMwMDA3LWI3YjVkMDE0MjU1NzllOGIxNGE3YTUyZmIxOWEzNTFlMTg2ZDE2YzUwMDE1YjZjMTQ4ZTYwNTc2MWRkMTNmMmM) for a social space to talk about the project and raise any questions you may have.
